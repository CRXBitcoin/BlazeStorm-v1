# BlazeStorm v1 - DDoS Penetration Testing Tool

BlazeStorm v2 is a DDoS (Denial of Service) tool intended for **educational and authorized testing purposes only**. This tool allows you to simulate a high-volume ping attack to a target system by sending large ICMP packets. It is a **penetration testing** tool meant to be used in legal and controlled environments where you have explicit permission to test the systems.

## Disclaimer

**Important**: Unauthorized use of this tool on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have written consent from the system owner before conducting any penetration testing.

By using this tool, you agree to assume all responsibility for your actions. The creator and contributors of this software do not condone or support illegal activities. Use at your own risk.

## Features
